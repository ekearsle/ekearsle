My background is in tropical forest ecology. My academic research focused on African and Neo-tropical forest
assessments of carbon dynamics and biodiversity. This work included organizing and performing extensive forest 
monitoring campaigns in the Congo Basin, French Guyana and Panama. I mainly worked on tropical forest community ecology,
linking plant traits to carbon storage, and investigating forest level seasonality in leaf development (phenology)
through the interplay of diverse tree speciesâ€™ responses to climate.

Through my consulting work in [BlueGreen Labs](https://bluegreenlabs.org), I am able to broaden my research topics to a variety of interests,
including tropical agriculture, agroforestry, food security and the connection with socioeconomic,
demographic and gender-based inequity.
